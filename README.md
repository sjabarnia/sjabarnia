## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Shiva - I am a Data Scientist with Nearmap working on some cool projects!
- Most recently I have started a project to look at how wildfires spread, this is a small piece of a larger inniciative we are running in Predict and Prevent, where our peril scores help clients get ready for dealing with different natual hazaards, from wildfires to hail, wind and hurricanes!

- Iâ€™m currently taking the MIT data science course to improve my understanding of the fundamentals... and oh boy am I learning something new every day! While it's a lot of work, I am very happy to have started my 2025 with this awesome course. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any thing related to wildfires and other natural perils! if you have an idea or a project in mind, please reach out - maybe we can help each other!
- How to reach me: sjabarnia@nearmap.com or jabarnia@gmail.com, happy to chat anytime!
